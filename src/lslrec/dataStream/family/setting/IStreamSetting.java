 * The stream_info object stores the declaration of a data stream.
 * Represents the following information:
 *  a) stream data format (#channels, channel format)
 *  b) core information (stream name, content type, sampling rate)
 *  c) optional meta-data about the stream content (channel labels, measurement units, etc.)
 *
 * Whenever a program wants to provide a new stream on the lab network it will typically first
 * create a stream_info to describe its properties and then construct a stream_outlet with it to create
 * the stream on the network. Recipients who discover the outlet can query the stream_info; it is also
 * written to disk when recording the stream (playing a similar role as a file header).
